# Aerosol_Optical_Depth_from_MODIS
An introduction on how to grab coarse-mode Aerosol Optical Depth (AODc), available on NASA EarthData

After qualifying for my PhD, I was understandably given advice from my committee members that ended up changing my research direction for my second chapter. 

This recommendation was to backtrack and form a more thorough foundation that my [earlier observations of Marine Aerosol Optical Depth (MAOD)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021JD034737) were in fact linked to tropospheric marine aerosol. I was given a simple way of going about this study. This was to examine whether magnitudes of MAOD increase on short timescales alongside an increase in wind speed, which would indicate the likely presence of sea spray aerosol contributing to MAOD observations. Another recommendation was to use a more well-cited method of marine tropospheric aerosol analysis: coarse-mode Aerosol Optical Depth, or AODc, and observe the same. What started out as a simple analysis has now bloomed into a full-scale chapter, and I'll be presenting on this work at [AGU next week](https://agu2021fallmeeting-agu.ipostersessions.com/Default.aspx?s=65-11-C0-5A-85-5A-9F-55-5C-42-3E-9F-5B-DC-45-FA&fbclid=IwAR0Hrdx840g-M3s88XAyUK4eo7syuOHF8xn6rkasEHcRdHlbjLoIt34REbw)!
